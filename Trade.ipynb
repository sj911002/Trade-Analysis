        "* Over the years from 1980-2000 we see that there is a slight linear relationship between the two goods(agricultural raw materials and ores & metals) being exported. We see in those years agricutural raw materials exporting percentages were slightly higher than that of ores and metals.\n",
        "* The years following 2000 an interesting observation can be made i.e. the exporting percentages of ore and metal have surpassed agricultural raw materials.\n",
        "* The next aspect is the size of the bubbles, the export value index. One factor contributing to the economy is the export and import indices. In this graph we see that in USA the export value index was considerably small in 1980s to 1985. This implies that economy of USA during this period was weak. A small export value index could either mean that demand for these goods has decreased, but in the case of USA, the country had suffered a severe recession during this period of time resulting in decline of exports which in turn explains the small export value index.\n",

        "In this stacked barchart, we see that countries half of the countries have more manufacture export % suggesting these countries have good economies(eg. Austria). Few countries have extremely high import %s (eg. Vanuatu and Malawi). Countries like Vanuatu have economies which are solely dependent on agriculture and tourism which explains the greater percentage in manufacture imports. Countries like Austria are much more advanced in technology and export machinery, equipment and other manufactured goods. In Singapore we see a very small gap between the 2 percentages therefore suggesting very good potential in it's economic growth. "

We can also see Germany, United States and France also export a lot of goods but on a level lower compared to that of China. One reason for this could be the availability of cheap, efficient and skillful labor in China."
