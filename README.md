# Trade-Analysis

In this project I have considered the dataset which deals with trade information for various countries over different timelines. The dataset was then cleaned and visualised. The visualisations provide a backbone to understand the inferences that have been listed.

This project consists of multivariate charts, multidimensional charts, temporal and hierachical data visualisations. All the columns and rows haven't been considered in this analysis for the sake of simplicity.
